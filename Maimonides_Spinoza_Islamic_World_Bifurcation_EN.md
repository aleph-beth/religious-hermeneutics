# **Maimonides, the Spinoza that the Islamic world never had?**

## **Introduction**

## Why was there no Spinoza in the Muslim world? A poorly framed question and a persistent blind spot

It has become commonplace in certain contemporary intellectual discourse to lament the absence of a “Spinoza” in the Arab or Muslim world. This complaint, often expressed in a critical or accusatory tone, is based on the implicit idea that a philosophical modernity comparable to that of Europe should have emerged in Islam, and that it failed to do so. However, such an expectation stems from a **major conceptual anachronism**: it projects onto another historical, linguistic, and theological-political world a figure—Baruch Spinoza—who is only intelligible after a long process internal to modern Europe.

Above all, this criticism ignores a decisive fact: the **intellectual function** that we retrospectively attribute to Spinoza had already been fulfilled several centuries earlier by Moses Maimonides, at the very heart of the medieval Islamic world. Maimonides was neither a marginal thinker nor an isolated philosopher on the periphery of Islam; he wrote in Judeo-Arabic, the philosophical language of his time, in the intellectual space of medieval Islam—between al-Andalus, the Maghreb, and Egypt—mobilizing Aristotle as transmitted and reworked by al-Farabi, Avicenna, and the tradition of the *falāsifa*. His project was explicitly opposed to forms of religious literalism, whether Jewish or Muslim, and aimed to **save causality**, the condition of possibility for science, intellect, and rational law.

The Guide for the Perplexed is not a defensive apologetic: it constitutes a genuine **epistemological rescue operation**. Maimonides seeks to prevent Revelation from destroying reason, just as reason dissolves the Law. He thus carries out an internal rationalization of religion, disciplining the reading of texts and hierarchizing levels of understanding, without breaking with the normative infrastructure of the Law.

Therefore, the relevant question is not: *“Why did the Islamic world not produce a Spinoza?”* but rather: **why want Spinoza where Maimonides' function was never fully assumed?* * For the emergence of a figure like Spinoza presupposes very specific conditions: full acceptance of necessary causality, a stabilized symbolic reading of texts, recognition of philosophy as an autonomous discipline, and a minimal secularization of politics. However, in the majority of the Islamic world, historical developments have led not to the consolidation of these conditions, but to their gradual weakening.

This study therefore proposes to shift the debate: it is not a question of measuring a lack or a delay, but of understanding **a historical bifurcation**, where the philosophical work inaugurated and brought to a high degree of coherence by Maimonides did not find the political and institutional conditions necessary to cross the threshold that only European modernity would make possible.

## **II. Maimonides and Spinoza: structural continuity, political divergence**



### **II.1. Guiding hypothesis**

Comparing Maimonides (1138–1204) and Spinoza (1632–1677) does not consist in establishing a direct filiation, but in identifying a **structural homology** : two critical rationalisms aimed at neutralizing anthropomorphism, reinterpreting prophecy, and subordinating religion to an order of intelligibility. The essential divergence does not concern “hard” metaphysical theses, but rather the **political conditions of possibility** for the autonomization of reason.

### **II.2. Detailed comparative table (axes, theses, functions, sources)**

| Axis | Maimonides (Guide for the Perplexed) | Spinoza (TTP / Ethics) | Epistemological consequence | Political-institutional condition |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Anthropomorphism** | **Absolute rejection**: God has neither body nor attributes in the human sense; recourse to **negative theology** (attributes \= negations)
 | **Absolute rejection**: God \= Nature; rejection of God as a person, criticism of emotional projection | Shift of religion towards a non-figurative conceptual grammar | Maimonides operates **within** a religious community order; Spinoza thinks **against** ecclesiastical power |
| **Miracle** | **Rationalization**: the miracle is not pure arbitrariness; it can be integrated into a providential/causal order (non-naive reading of the stories) | **Impossibility**: a “miracle” against the order of Nature is a contradiction; “miracles” are ignored effects or political narratives | Stabilization of nature as an intelligible order | Modern Europe (emerging science, confessional controversies) makes criticism of miracles politically useful as a tool of authority |
| **Causality / Nature** | **Necessary causality** (Aristotelian-Avicennian framework): intelligibility of the world and hierarchy of causes; God is not a capricious agent | **Necessary causality**: determinism; rejection of free will in the theological sense; nature \= order and connection of causes | Rationalist foundation of science and ethics | Maimonides must maintain compatibility with the Law; Spinoza can absolutize necessity without losing institutional standing |
| **Prophecy** | **Perfected intellect \+ imagination**: prophecy presupposes an exceptional degree of intellect (intellectual agent) and a regulated imaginative faculty | **Imagination**: prophecy belongs to an imaginative/emotional register, adapted to the people; it is not demonstrative knowledge | Separation of regimes of truth: demonstration vs. imagination | For Spinoza, prophecy serves to conceive of the governance of emotions in the state; for Maimonides, it remains a norm of the sacred |
| **Reading of the text** | **Obligatory symbolism**: the letter is sometimes pedagogy; philosophical interpretation is necessary to avoid contradiction/anthropomorphism | **Historical-critical**: philological and contextual method; meaning \= intention and usage; critique of interpretive authority | Transformation of exegesis into a rational method | Maimonides addresses an elite, under the constraint of religious order; Spinoza publishes in a Europe where textual criticism becomes possible |
| **Law (Torah/Sharia/religion)** | **Rational pedagogy**: the Law shapes morals, disciplines passions, structures the city; it is useful even if its deeper meaning is philosophical | **Political mechanism**: “religion” is a system of obedience and civil peace; the law belongs to the state, not to the clergy | Shift in normativity: from revelation to politics | The modern state allows for the dissociation of legal norms from religious norms; this is the “threshold” that is absent in Maimonides |
| **Freedom** | Freedom as intellectual perfection (teleology) and control of the passions through education and law | Freedom \= understanding of necessity; autonomy \= power to act through adequate knowledge | Reconfiguration of ethics | In modernity, freedom becomes a problem of political sovereignty and rights; in the 12th century, it remains embedded in the community order |
| **Finality / Teleology** | Strong teleology: the law aims at human perfection and knowledge of God | Anti-teleology: nature does not act with ends in view; critique of finalist superstition | Transition from a cosmos oriented toward an immanent order | The modern rejection of teleology accompanies new science; Maimonides remains within an Aristotelian framework |
| **Religious authority** | Regulated authority: the philosophical elite must protect the people from confusion, without dissolving order | Criticism of theological-political tyranny; neutralization of the clergy | Transition from elitist pedagogy to a theory of domination | Only possible in a space where civil institutions can challenge religious institutions |

---

### **II.3. Discussion (historical reading)**

#### **1\) Structural continuity: rationalizing without abolishing religion**

On the central doctrinal points—anti-anthropomorphism, intelligibility of the world, distinction between registers of truth—Maimonides already accomplishes much of what modernity will attribute to Spinoza: **disenchanting the letter** to save the coherence of truth. The difference is that Maimonides remained within a strategy of **internal reconciliation**: the Law must remain the common architecture, because it is the condition for ethical and political stability.

#### **2) Political divergence: the modern “threshold”**

Spinoza writes after a series of institutional transformations that change the place of religion:

* the crisis of the wars of religion (violence in the name of interpretation); 
* the rise of sovereign states and administration; 
* the development of a literate public space;
 
* the gradual empowerment of science and law.

In this new framework, criticism is no longer merely hermeneutic: it becomes **legal-political**. Spinoza can therefore treat religion as an instrument of government of the emotions and defend the autonomy of the state against the clergy.

#### **3\) Operational conclusion**

The thesis can be formulated as follows:

* **Maimonides achieves a maximum of critical rationalism compatible with a world where the Law is the infrastructure of social order.**
* **Spinoza accomplishes the same feat, but crosses the modern threshold: religious law is no longer necessary as the foundation of politics.**

In other words, Maimonides carries out the “pre-Spinozist” work (de-anthropomorphization, hierarchization of meanings, rationalization of prophecy and miracles), **without being able—or willing—to convert this work into a theory of political sovereignty**, because the corresponding institutions do not yet exist.

## **III. Internal blockages in the majority Islamic world**

### **III.1. The weakening of causality: Acharite occasionalism and the fragility of rational “necessity”**

In mainstream Sunni Islam, the decisive turning point is not simply anti-intellectualism, but a **metaphysical reconfiguration**: causality is no longer a necessity inscribed in nature, but becomes a **habit** (*ʿāda*) established and renewed by God. This position, solidified in **Acharite** theology, aims to preserve a central principle: ** divine omnipotence** and the possibility of miracles. The world is intelligible, but **not necessary** in the strong sense: what we call “natural laws” are only contingent, “revocable” regularities. 

**Sunni (Ash'ari) position:**

* **God is the only true agent**: no creature has autonomous causal power (no intrinsic “power” of fire to burn, for example).

* The cause-effect link is a **non-necessary** link: it is based on the divine decision to maintain the ordinary order.

* Epistemological consequence: reason can describe regularities, but struggles to establish a stable ontological necessity (in the Aristotelian/Avicennian-Averroist sense).

**Canonical turning point: al-Ghazālī**
Al-Ghazālī, in his critique of philosophers (*Tahāfut al-falāsifa*), specifically attacks the idea that natural causes **necessitate** their effects, because, according to him, this would limit divine intervention (miracles) and threaten the uniqueness of divine action.
 
This is not a rejection of empirical observation, but a rejection of “necessitarian” metaphysical inference. 

**Philosophical response: Ibn Rushd**
 
Ibn Rushd replies (notably in *Tahāfut al-tahāfut*) that strict occasionalism makes science problematic: if the causal chain has no ontological stability, then human knowledge loses its basis. The conflict is therefore **epistemological**: science presupposes a form of causal stability.
 

**Challenge for “Maimonides → Spinoza”:**
A Spinoza-type trajectory assumes that nature is understood as a **necessary order**, intelligible “in itself,” and not as a simple **renewed decree**. Acharism does not eliminate all rationality, but it **degrades** necessity (and thus the metaphysical basis of a radical rationalist critique of religion).

---

### **III.2. The marginalization of symbolic reading: from legitimate *ta’wīl* to suspicion of polysemy**

To be precise, Sunni Islam does not ignore interpretation. It distinguishes, broadly speaking, between:

* **tafsīr**: “external” commentary (language, context, tradition),

* **ta'wīl**: interpretation oriented towards an “other” meaning, sometimes allegorical.

But the controversy concerns the **scope** and **legitimacy** of philosophical and speculative *ta’wīl*. As Sunni orthodoxy stabilizes, polysemy is no longer an open space for thought: it becomes a **doctrinal risk** (fragmentation, reprehensible innovation, loss of normative control).

**Majority Sunni position (trend):**

* Mutashābihāt* (ambiguous) verses must be treated with caution; *ta'wīl* is accepted **within certain limits**, often reserved for qualified scholars.

* “Philosophical” *ta'wīl* (which draws on Greek metaphysics, necessary causality, intellectual hierarchies) is gradually perceived as an **external reinterpretation** imposed on the text.

**Hanbali-Salafi crystallization (anti-ta’wīl):**
In the **Hanbali** tradition and later in the works of **Ibn Taymiyyah** (d. 1328), we see a more direct criticism of allegorical *ta’wīl*: priority is given to the apparent meaning, to tradition, and to the avoidance of speculative constructions perceived as imported. Even if Ibn Taymiyyah does not exhaust Sunnism, his modern influence (Salafism) accentuates **distrust** of philosophical symbolic interpretation.

**Challenge for “Maimonides → Spinoza”:** 
Spinoza, in a modern register, assumes a hermeneutic in which:

1. the text is historically situated,

2. the plurality of meanings is controlled by a critical method,

3. religious authority loses its monopoly. 
However, in the majority Sunni configuration, polysemy tends to be **re-closed** in order to preserve doctrinal and legal unity.

---

### **III.3. The disqualification of philosophy: from an internal tool to suspicion of external influence (Greek, elitist, subversive)**

Philosophy (falsafa) did indeed exist **in** the Islamic world, and at a high level. But within the Sunni majority, it underwent a process of **delegitimization**: not because it was “reason” in general, but because it embodies a **speculative metaphysical** reason that is considered dangerous when it claims to arbitrate religion.

**Sunni position:**

* Sunni Islam values rational knowledge (logic, language, law) as long as it remains **instrumental** to the preservation of the Law.

* Falsafa becomes problematic when it:

* proposes an autonomous cosmology (necessitarianism),

* redefines prophecy and revelation,

* hierarchizes readings of the text in favor of a philosophical elite.

This is precisely the core of al-Ghazālī's anti-falsafa criticism: philosophy is accused of crossing a threshold where it no longer serves religion but **reconfigures** it.

**After the 13th century: defensive consolidation**
Even when historical nuances are taken into account (the narrative of “automatic decline after 1258” is debated), some recent literature shows that the post-Mongol conquest period changed infrastructures and balances: the reproduction of knowledge became more organized around normative disciplines (law, tradition), and falsafa became more marginal. Recent work, however, invites us to qualify the idea of a uniform and irreversible collapse, speaking instead of **reconfigurations** of modes of transmission (manuscripts, scholarly networks).

**Challenge for “Maimonides → Spinoza”:**
Maimonides carried out an internal rationalization of the Law (philosophy as a method). Spinoza crossed an additional threshold: philosophy became the **sovereign authority** for judging nature, Scripture, and politics.
 
The disqualification of falsafa in mainstream Sunni Islam means that this philosophical sovereignty is perceived not as an internal maturation, but as an **illegitimate rupture**.

## **IV. Historical and epistemological context of philosophy in Islam: before and after the Mongol conquests**

###

### **IV.1. Before the Mongol conquests (8th–12th centuries): an age of translation, synthesis, and fruitful tension**

Between the 8th and early 13th centuries, the Islamic world was one of the most dynamic intellectual centers in the Mediterranean and Near East. This era, often referred to as the “classical age” or “golden age” of Islam, was marked by intense activity in the translation, appropriation, and transformation of ancient heritage.

Under the Abbasids, and particularly in Baghdad, the *Bayt al-Ḥikma* (House of Wisdom) played a structuring role. Greek (Aristotle, Plotinus, Galen), Syriac, and Persian works were translated into Arabic, not as mere scholarly curiosities, but as conceptual tools for thinking about theology, law, and cosmology.

It was in this context that the *falāsifa* (al-Kindī, al-Fārābī, Avicenna, then Averroes) developed. Their project was not to secularize revelation, but to make it intelligible:

* causality is conceived as necessary; 
* the human intellect is capable of accessing the order of reality; 
* the Law (sharīʿa) must be understood at different levels, including a rational and symbolic level.

At the same time, rationalist theological currents (Muʿtazilism) and forms of structured esotericism (Ismailism, Imamite Shiism) maintained a plurality of interpretation. Philosophy was not yet external to Islam: it was one of its possible internal languages.

This period is therefore characterized by a **fruitful tension**: Revelation imposes a normative framework, but philosophical reason remains a legitimate tool for exploring its deeper meaning. It is in this space that Maimonides can write in Judeo-Arabic, at the very heart of the Islamic world, without appearing to be a foreign body.

---

### **IV.2. The Mongol conquests (13th century):
 
political rupture, civilizational trauma, and normative retreat**

The Mongol conquests of the 13th century (the capture of Baghdad in 1258, the collapse of the Abbasid Caliphate) constituted a major rupture, not only politically but also epistemologically. They caused a lasting shock to the intellectual structures of the Islamic world.

The destruction of urban centers, libraries, and scholarly institutions led to the collapse of knowledge transmission networks. But more profoundly, the historical trauma changed the relationship to knowledge:

* the stability of the world was perceived as radically fragile; 
* history appeared to be dominated by arbitrariness and catastrophe; 
* the priority shifted from the intelligibility of the world to the preservation of religious and social order.

In this context, voluntarist theology (Acharism) found particularly fertile ground. The idea of necessary causality, already contested, becomes suspect: if the world can be destroyed at any moment, it is because it is not based on intelligible laws, but on absolute divine will.

Philosophy, associated with an urban elite and a collapsed old order, is gradually discredited. Averroes is marginalized, then neutralized; the falāsifa ceased to be a living tradition and became an object of refutation or marginal scholarship.

---

### **IV.3. After the Mongol conquests (14th–18th centuries): closure of the philosophical field and juridification of knowledge**

After the Mongol shock, the Islamic world entered a phase of **defensive recomposition**. Knowledge was reorganized around disciplines considered to be stabilizing: fiqh (law), ḥadīth, grammar, and an increasingly normative theology.

Philosophy was not completely absent, but it was either:

* integrated in a subordinate manner into closed theological frameworks; 
* shifted towards mystical or symbolic forms (Sufism), often cut off from causal science; 
* or preserved in very minority circles (philosophical Shiism, Ismailism).

This is not a simple “forgetting” of philosophy, but a **functional rejection**: causal thinking becomes politically and theologically risky in a world that seeks above all cohesion and survival. The closure of ijtihad, whether real or symbolic, expresses this desire for stabilization.

Unlike in modern Europe, where crisis (religious wars) led to the empowerment of reason and politics, the post-Mongol Islamic crisis led to a strengthening of religious authority and increased mistrust of philosophical speculation.

---

### **IV.4. Long-term consequence: not a delay, but a historical bifurcation**

It is essential to emphasize that this development should not be interpreted as a “delay” in the Islamic world, but as a **historical bifurcation**. From the 13th century onwards, the conditions that made possible a trajectory of the Maimonides → Spinoza type disappeared.

Philosophy was no longer in a position to carry out an internal rationalization of the Law. It became external, suspect, or symbolically neutralized. Under these conditions, the emergence of a radical critique of Revelation, such as that of Spinoza, was structurally impossible.

This observation allows us to reformulate the central thesis of the document:

The Islamic world did not “miss out” on modern philosophy; under extreme historical constraints, it chose another strategy for intellectual survival, one that was incompatible with the causal empowerment of reason.

It is therefore not the absence of genius or intellectual resources that explains the decline of philosophy, but a series of historical ruptures, with the Mongol conquests constituting the decisive turning point.

## **V. Historical consequences: an interrupted trajectory and its conditions of possibility**

The analysis of historical consequences cannot be limited to a factual observation or a linear narrative of the “decline of philosophy” type. On the contrary, a scientific approach requires **reconstructing the chains of transmission, institutional conditions, and political constraints** that make certain intellectual trajectories possible—and others impossible. The following three phenomena must be understood as **structural effects**, not as biographical accidents.

---

### **V.1. Averroes: from philosophical centrality to institutional marginalization**

Ibn Rushd (Averroes, 1126–1198) represents the culmination of Sunni *falāsifa*: defense of necessary causality, autonomy of demonstrative reason, hierarchization of modes of discourse (philosophical, theological, rhetorical) . From a strictly doctrinal point of view, his work constitutes the closest Islamic equivalent of what European modernity would later recognize as rationalism.

However, intellectual history shows that **the theoretical value of a work is never enough to guarantee its survival**. After his political disgrace in Cordoba and Marrakesh, Averroes was not integrated into lasting institutions of philosophical transmission. His texts circulated, but without becoming the basis of a normative curriculum. Philosophy, as an autonomous discipline, did not become institutionalized in mainstream Sunni Islam.

Methodologically, a distinction must therefore be made between:

* the **presence of a philosophical discourse** (Averroes exists, writes, argues);

* and its **institutional inscription** (universities, programs, reproduction of elites).

It is precisely this second dimension that is lacking. Averroes is not only refuted on a theoretical level; he is **neutralized by marginalization**, that is, deprived of the social conditions for continuity. His posterity will be mainly European (Latin Averroism), not Islamic.

---

### **V.2. Maimonides: a work made possible by Islam, preserved by Judaism**

The case of Maimonides (1138–1204) is historically decisive for understanding the mechanisms of preservation and transmission. His work is inseparable from the medieval Islamic world: language (Judeo-Arabic), philosophical categories (Aristotelianism of Avicenna), theological debates (causality, divine attributes, prophecy). Without classical Islam, Maimonides is historically unthinkable.

However, the **preservation and canonization** of Maimonides did not take place in Islam, but in Judaism. The reason for this is institutional rather than doctrinal: diasporic Judaism, lacking central political power, developed forms of interpretative pluralism and scholarly transmission that allowed for the lasting integration of a philosophical rationalization of the Law.

From a methodological point of view, this confirms a central principle of the history of ideas:

**it is not the origin of a thought that determines its posterity, but the structure of the group that receives it.**

Medieval and modern Judaism can integrate Maimonides as a major authority without threatening a centralized political-legal order. The majority Islamic world, faced with other historical constraints, does not produce the same dynamic of philosophical conservation.

---

### **V.3. The structural impossibility of the transition from Maimonides to Spinoza**

The transition from Maimonides to Spinoza is not a simple doctrinal continuity; it presupposes a **change in the intellectual and political regime**. 
A historical approach here requires us to reject any teleology: Spinoza is not the “natural future” of Maimonides. He is the product of another world.

For such a transition to be possible, several cumulative conditions must be met:

* a **stable acceptance of necessary causality** as the foundation of reality;

* an **institutionalized critical hermeneutics**, independent of religious authority;

* an **autonomization of law and science** vis-à-vis religious law;

* the existence of a **modern state** capable of neutralizing confessional conflicts.

These conditions are not met in the post-classical Islamic world, not because of intellectual deficiency, but because of **historical bifurcation**: political crises, imperial reorganizations, and dominant theological choices lead to a strengthening of religious normativity rather than its dissociation from politics.

In contrast, modern Europe—notably through the United Provinces—offered a unique space where criticism of religion became conceivable without the immediate destruction of the social order. Spinoza is therefore a **contextual outcome**, not simply a figure of isolated genius.

---

### **V.4. Methodological conclusion: against the myth of the intellectual “leap”**

From a scientific point of view, it is essential to remember that **there is no direct leap in the history of ideas**. Major transformations are always mediated by institutions, crises, legal frameworks, and structures of transmission.

Thus:

* there is no “leap” from Averroes to Spinoza;

* there is no mechanical transition from Maimonides to modernity;

* Spinoza is not a starting point, but a **point of arrival**, made possible by a specific historical sequence.

The consequence is not that the Islamic world “failed” where Europe “succeeded,” but that **distinct intellectual trajectories emerged under different constraints**. Understanding these constraints, rather than making value judgments, is at the heart of the historian's approach.

## ***Conclusion — A major historical irony: bifurcation, transmission, and secularization***

### ***1\. Methodological caution: avoiding retrospective teleology***

*A conclusion in intellectual history cannot consist of distributing successes and failures according to a modern criterion projected retrospectively. On the contrary, the method requires us to distinguish between:*

* *the **conditions of possibility** of a work,*

* *its **conditions of reception**,*

* *and its **conditions of transformation**.*

*It is on this threefold scale that what can be described as **structural historical irony** manifests itself: a thought may be made possible by a given world, without that world being able or willing to assume the ultimate consequences of that thought.*

---

### ***2\. The Islamic world: production of conditions, functional rejection of consequences***

*From a strictly historical point of view, the medieval Islamic world produced all the intellectual conditions necessary for the emergence of Maimonides:*

* *a unified philosophical language (Arabic) capable of integrating Aristotle;*

* *a living rationalist tradition (falāsifa, Muʿtazilism);*

* *a space of productive tension between revelation, law, and reason.*

*Maimonides is therefore not an anomaly, but a **coherent product** of this ecosystem.
 However, analysis shows that this same structure could not accept Maimonides's approach being taken to its extreme consequences. As long as rationalization remains **internal to the Law**—as a pedagogy of passions and social stabilization—it is tolerable; when it threatens to redefine normative authority or empower reason, it becomes problematic.*

*This is not an explicit rejection of Maimonides, but a **functional refusal** of what his project implies in the long term: the increasing subordination of the revealed letter to autonomous rational intelligibility.*

---

### ***3\. Europe: a legacy mediated by diasporic Judaism and secularization***

*Modern Europe did not inherit directly from Maimonides via Islam, but **through diasporic Judaism**, whose institutional structure played a decisive role. Deprived of political sovereignty based on religion, Judaism developed forms of transmission based on study, interpretative controversy, and the plurality of scholarly authorities.*

*This framework allowed Maimonidean rationalism to be:*

1. ***preserved** (translations, commentaries, canonization);*

2. ***radicalized** (gradual desacralization of religious authority);*

3. ***secularized** (transfer of normativity to politics and science).*

*Spinoza does not constitute a break ex nihilo, but the culmination of a process made possible by an unprecedented context: religious wars, the formation of the modern state, the empowerment of law and science, and the emergence of a critical public sphere. Where Maimonides rationalizes the Law in order to save it, Spinoza is able to neutralize its political function.*

---

### ***4\. Contemporary confusion: modern rupture and unfinished medieval work***

*Complaining today about the absence of a Spinoza in the Arab or Muslim world is, methodologically, tantamount to **confusing two heterogeneous temporalities**:*

* *that of a medieval work of internal rationalization of religion;*

* *that of a modern rupture based on the secularization of politics.*

*Spinoza is neither a universal model nor a natural starting point. He is a **contextual outcome**, the product of a specific historical bifurcation. Expecting him to emerge outside of these conditions is not a matter of historical analysis, but of normative projection.*

---

### ***5\. Closing statement (stabilized)***

*We can therefore conclude in a rigorously historical manner:*

*The Islamic world did not miss Spinoza. It produced Maimonides, but did not institutionalize the philosophical consequences of his work. Europe, through diasporic Judaism, inherited this work, radicalized it, and then secularized it. To complain about the absence of a Spinoza without recognizing the presence of Maimonides is to confuse a modern break with an unfinished medieval work.*

*Or, in condensed form:*

***Spinoza is not missed where Maimonides was never fully embraced.***
