# **Secularism and reason in the Semitic world: Al-Fārābī and Midrash as keys to rethinking the debate**

# **Introduction**

**Hook**: *“In France, secularism is often perceived as a bulwark against religious irrationality. However, this opposition ignores a thousand-year-old heritage: that of Semitic philosophers and exegetes who made reason a universal language for understanding sacred texts. What if the solution to contemporary tensions lay in rediscovering Al-Fārābī and the Midrash?”*

**Context**:

* **Al-Fārābī** showed that the angel Gabriel is not a supernatural messenger, but a **figure of reason**, where light symbolizes intellect and knowledge. 
* The **Gospels**, far from being literal accounts, are a **midrashic rewriting** (Halakha and Agada) of the Jewish Scriptures, combining **ethical teachings** (the words of Jesus) and **symbolic narratives** (the life of Jesus).
 
* Result: debates on secularism are polarized around symbols (veil, kippah) rather than **texts** and their interpretations.

**Problem**: French secularism, heir to the Enlightenment, was built on a binary opposition between **reason** and **religion**, ignoring the rational currents of monotheism. However:

* **Who knows that Al-Farabi influenced Thomas Aquinas?** 
* **Who is familiar with the midrashic art behind Jesus' parables?**
 
* **Who understands that religions developed critical tools long before the Enlightenment?**

**Central question**: How can these philosophical and exegetical traditions help to **depolarize the debate** and **combat extremism** by placing reason at the heart of the understanding of religions?

**Outline**: We will first explore how Al-Fārābī and the Midrash offer models of rationality, then analyze the shortcomings of French secularism, before proposing concrete solutions for an “enlightened” approach.

# **1\. Reason at the heart of Semitic traditions: Al-Fārābī and the Midrash, two models of rationality**

## **1.1. Al-Fārābī: the angel as a representation of reason**

In the Sunni tradition, the angel Gabriel is often perceived as a heavenly messenger transmitting the Quran in a literal sense. **For Al-Fārābī, the angel is not a supernatural entity, but reason itself.** Here's why:

* **The angel as a metaphor for the intellect**: Al-Fārābī, in works such as *The Virtuous City* and *The Book of Letters*, explains that the angel is not a divine intermediary, but **reason in action**. Light, often associated with angels, symbolizes **pure intelligence**—a force that illuminates the human mind, just as light reveals an object in the darkness.

* *Concrete example*: When the Quran refers to the descent of the angel Gabriel, Al-Fārābī sees it as a process in which **reason imposes itself on the mind of the Prophet**. It is not a miraculous revelation, but a **rational understanding**, accessible through both prophecy and philosophy.
 
* *Key quote*: *“The prophet is one who perceives through intuition what others attain through demonstration.”* (Al-Fārābī, *Kitāb al-Milla*). 
* *Implication*: The Quran is not a text “sent down from heaven,” but the result of **rational illumination**, where truth is revealed through logic and reflection.
 
* **The Quran as a work of reason**: For Al-Fārābī, the stories in the Quran (such as the creation of Adam or the revelation) are not historical events, but **philosophical symbols**. The language of the Quran is accessible to all, but philosophers grasp its hidden meaning: a **truth accessible through reason**.

* *Why it is revolutionary*: This vision desacralizes the idea of a “dictated” Quran and makes it a text **compatible with logic**, an idea that challenges the sterile opposition between ‘Islam’ and “reason.”

## **1.2. The Gospels as Midrash: a combination of Halakha and Agada**

**Midrash** (מדרש) is a Jewish method of interpreting Scripture, divided into two branches:

1. **Halakha** (הלכה): Legal and ethical exegesis, focused on the practical application of the law. 
2. **Agada** (אגדה): Narrative and symbolic exegesis, exploring biblical stories to extract moral or theological teachings.

The Gospels are not simply a historical account or a work of fiction. They can be understood as a **Midrash combining Halakha and Agada**:

* **Midrash Halakha**: The **teachings of Jesus** (Sermon on the Mount, parables) are a **creative reinterpretation of the Torah**. Jesus acts as a **master of Halakha**, offering a renewed reading of Jewish law.

* *Example*: *“You have heard that it was said... but I say to you...”* (Matthew 5) shows Jesus **commenting on and updating** Mosaic law, in the manner of a midrashic rabbi.
 
* *Another example*: Jesus' debates with the Pharisees on the Sabbath (Mark 2:23-28) or ritual purity (Mark 7:1-23) are part of a **halakhic discussion**, in which he reinterprets the commandments.
 
* **Midrash Agada**: The **accounts of Jesus' life** (Nativity, Passion, Resurrection) are **symbolic narratives**, constructed like Agadot to convey spiritual truths.

* *Example*: The multiplication of the loaves (Mark 6:35-44) is not a “magical” miracle, but a **midrashic re-enactment** of the manna in the desert (Exodus 16). The five loaves refer to the **Five Books of the Torah**, and the two fish to the **Tablets of the Law**, emphasizing that Jesus fulfills and surpasses Jewish tradition. 
* *Another example*: The Transfiguration (Matthew 17:1-9) is a scene rich in symbols (the mountain, the light, Moses and Elijah), typical of an **agadic narrative**.
 
* **Why this reading is rational**: Midrash is not an arbitrary “invention,” but a **rigorous hermeneutical method**, based on:

* **Textual analysis**: Wordplay, repetitions, silences in the text. 
* **Internal consistency**: The Gospels follow a **narrative logic** (e.g., the 40 days of temptation in the desert = the 40 years of Israel's wandering).
* **Dialogue with tradition**: The authors of the Gospels, Hellenized Jews, were familiar with these techniques and applied them to their own message.

**Consequences for secularism**: Understanding the Gospels as a **Midrash Halakha and Agada** allows us to approach them **without literalism**, and therefore without conflict with science or reason. However, this approach is rarely taught, even in theology faculties.

## **1.3. An ignored common heritage**

Al-Fārābī and the Midrash show that **reason and revelation are not opposed**:

* One places the Koranic revelation in a **philosophical** framework.
* The other reveals that the Gospels are **constructed texts**, using precise literary codes. **Yet in France:** 
* Who knows that Al-Fārābī influenced Thomas Aquinas?
 
* Who is familiar with the midrashic art behind the teachings and stories of Jesus?
* As a result, religions are reduced to dogmas, even though they developed **critical tools** long before the Enlightenment.

*If these traditions offer keys to reconciling faith and reason, why does French secularism ignore them? And how does this ignorance fuel current tensions?*

# ***2\. French secularism: a legacy of the Enlightenment at odds with Semitic traditions***

## ***2.1. A structural misunderstanding of rational currents***

*French secularism, heir to the Enlightenment, was built on a binary opposition between **reason** and **religion**, ignoring the philosophical and exegetical traditions of Semitic monotheisms. This misunderstanding has profound consequences:*

* ***In national education**:*

* ***Absence of teaching the history of religions**: Unlike countries such as Germany or the United Kingdom, where the history of religions is integrated into school curricula, France deprives itself of an essential tool for understanding sacred texts and their interpretations.* 
* *Example: Only **12% of French high school students** have heard of Averroes (IFOP survey, 2020), even though this philosopher influenced Thomas Aquinas and Christian scholasticism.*
 
* *Consequence: Young French people are unfamiliar with **rational currents of Islam** (such as Al-Fārābī's falsafa), **Jewish exegesis methods** (such as Midrash), and **Christian philosophical traditions** (such as patristics).*
 
* ***In the media**:*

* ***Focus on controversies**: Public debates focus on symbols (headscarves, kippahs, pork-free menus) rather than on **texts** and their interpretations.* 
* *Example: Media coverage of “separatism” ignores reformist currents in Islam (such as the Islam of the Enlightenment advocated by Tareq Oubrou) or critical readings of the Quran (such as those of the Mu'tazilites).*
* *Result: Religions are reduced to dogmas, without ever addressing their philosophical dimension.*
 
* ***In places of worship**:*

* *There is little space for **critical debate** on sacred texts. Mosques, synagogues, and churches often remain places of traditional transmission, with no openness to rational currents.*

***Key quote**: “One cannot understand the Gospels without the Talmud, nor the Quran without Aristotle. By ignoring these links, secularism deprives itself of tools to fight obscurantism.” — Abdennour Bidar*

## ***2.2. The consequences of this ignorance***

*This lack of knowledge fuels tensions and misunderstandings:*

* ***For Muslims:***

* *Islam is often reduced to its **literalist** dimension (Salafism), whereas figures such as **Averroes** and **Al-Fārābī** have shown its compatibility with reason.* 
* *Example: Debates on the veil or radical Islam ignore **reformist currents** (such as Sufism or liberal Islam), which offer contextual and critical readings of the Quran.* 
* ***For Jews**:*

* *The **Midrash** and the writings of **Maimonides** remain confined to specialized circles, even though they offer keys to understanding the Gospels and rabbinic tradition.*
* *Consequence: The contribution of Judaism to Western thought is misunderstood (e.g., the influence of Philo of Alexandria on early Christianity). .* 
* ***For Christians**:*

* *Scholasticism and patristic thought (such as that of Origen or John Damascene) are forgotten, even though they shaped medieval theology and philosophy.* 
* *As a result, Christianity is often perceived as folklore, with no reference to its intellectual dimension.*

## ***2.3. “Blind” secularism in the face of contemporary challenges***

*By refusing to teach religions (for fear of proselytism), French secularism produces generations that **understand neither their own religious history nor that of others**:*

* ***How can we debate the Quran** if we are unaware that Al-Fārābī saw it as a text compatible with reason?*
* ***How can we understand the Gospels** without knowing the Talmud or the writings of Philo of Alexandria?*
* ***How can we combat extremism** without studying **critical interpretations** of sacred texts?*

***European comparison**: Countries such as Germany and the United Kingdom include the study of religions in their school curricula, not to indoctrinate, but to **provide critical tools** to their citizens. France, on the other hand, lags behind in this regard.*

---

## ***2.4. The risks of dogmatic secularism***

* ***Reinforcing divisions**: By ignoring the rational traditions of religions, French secularism contributes to **polarizing debates** (e.g., the opposition between “Islam” and “the republic”).* 
* ***Political instrumentalization**: Discourse on “radicalization” or “communitarianism” focuses on symbols, without ever addressing the **texts** or **interpretations** that could shed light on these phenomena.*
 
* ***Weakening the fight against extremism**: Without knowledge of rational currents, the field is left open to **fundamentalist discourse**, which thrives on ignorance.*

***Concrete example**: In Egypt, intellectuals such as **Nasr Hamid Abu Zayd** have used linguistics and history to show that the Quran is a **contextual and interpretable** text, thereby weakening Salafist discourse. Why does France not draw inspiration from these approaches?*

# **Conclusion**

**Summary**:

* **Al-Fārābī** and the **Midrash** demonstrate that religions are not irrational dogmas, but traditions **structured by reason** (Islamic philosophy, Jewish exegesis). . 
* The **Gospels**, as Midrash Halakha (teachings of Jesus) and Agada (symbolic narratives), illustrate a **rigorous hermeneutic method** that is compatible with modernity.
 
* By ignoring this heritage, French secularism deprives itself of tools for **understanding sacred texts** and **combating fundamentalism**.

**Call to action**: *“What if we started by teaching Al-Fārābī in high schools, organizing workshops on Midrash in libraries, and disseminating this knowledge in the media? Reason is not the enemy of religion—it is the key to understanding it.”*

**Opening**: *“Medieval Andalusia showed us that when reason becomes a common language, cultures engage in dialogue. It is up to us to reinvent this legacy for the 21st century.”*
