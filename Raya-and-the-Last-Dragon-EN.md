# Trust after fear
## Raya and the Last Dragon, or the rebuilding of political ties in a fragmented world
For Marie.

## Introduction
Animated films, long perceived as a narrative space intended mainly for children, are increasingly establishing themselves as philosophical and political laboratories in their own right. By depicting imaginary worlds, it highlights deeply contemporary tensions: the fragmentation of societies, the legacy of collective trauma, widespread mistrust, and the difficulty of rebuilding a common future. In this context, Raya and the Last Dragon (Disney, 2021) occupies a unique place.
The film does not merely recount a classic heroic quest. It offers a structured meditation on trust and mistrust, thought of not as simple individual moral dispositions, but as organizing principles of politics. Through the broken world of Kumandra, Disney depicts a post-traumatic society where fear has become the norm and survival has replaced cooperation as the common goal.
Raya's originality lies in its rejection of Manichaeism. There is no absolute evil, nor miraculous salvation. The catastrophe is not attributable to an external enemy, but to the collapse of social bonds themselves. In this context, trust does not appear as a naive virtue or a rewarded sentiment, but as a risky, costly, and politically decisive act, without which no rebuilding of the world is possible.
This text proposes to analyze Raya and the Last Dragon as a contemporary political tale, articulating three levels of interpretation. First, it will show how the film constructs an initiatory narrative in a fragmented world, where geographical space reflects the dislocation of social bonds. We will then examine the film's central philosophical themes—trust, mistrust, collective responsibility, and the memory of trauma—in order to understand the ethical logic underlying the narrative. Finally, this analysis will be put into perspective with other films from the Disney corpus, before opening up to a comparative reading mobilizing Spinoza, Hobbes, and Hannah Arendt, to question the possibility of a political re-foundation after fear.
## I. Introducing Raya and the Last Dragon: a coming-of-age story in a fragmented world
### 1. The narrative and symbolic framework
The story is set in Kumandra, a world that was once unified around the same political and symbolic balance, but is now deeply fragmented. This fragmentation is not only territorial: it reflects a breakdown in social ties and a widespread loss of trust between peoples. The geographical space thus becomes a mirror of a dislocated political space, where each group withdraws into itself in a logic of protection and survival.
The founding catastrophe—the disappearance of the dragons and the petrification of the inhabitants—marks an anthropological shift. It breaks the old order based on cooperation and ushers in a world dominated by fear. From this event onwards, mistrust becomes the norm, almost an implicit law, structuring all social relations.
The Druun embody this fear that has become active. They are not enemies with their own intentions, but the materialization of collective mistrust. Their presence signals the collapse of the bond: where trust disappears, they appear. Evil is not external to the world; it is the direct product of its internal fragmentation.
### 2. Raya, a tragic heroine rather than a naive heroine
Raya differs from classic heroic figures in her lack of initial innocence. Her childhood is marked by betrayal, a seminal event that seals both the fall of Kumandra and the formation of her character. This traumatic moment places loss at the heart of her relationship with the world and has a lasting impact on her choices.
The heroine is not guided by abstract idealism, but by a rationality forged by trauma. Her mistrust is neither a moral flaw nor a weakness: it is the logical consequence of a violent experience of the world. Raya acts with caution, strategy, and calculation in a world where trust has already led to disaster.
Her journey of initiation does not consist of learning strength or domination, but of accepting a radical act of trust, taken in full awareness of the risk. This transformation does not lead her to become naive again, but to move beyond an exclusively defensive rationality and enter into an ethic of assumed risk.
### 3. A political tale structure
The world of Kumandra is made up of specialized kingdoms, each with a particular resource, skill, or strategic position. However, this specialization does not produce functional complementarity. On the contrary, it creates a structural inability to cooperate, with each entity seeking to maximize its own security at the expense of the common good.
The narrative is distinguished by the absence of an absolute villain. Conflicts do not result from isolated malicious intent, but from systemic logics: inherited fear, wounded memory, incompatible defensive rationalities. Evil is diffuse, distributed throughout the very structures of the world.
The final resolution confirms this political reading. Salvation comes neither from military force, strategic cunning, nor individual moral superiority. It emerges solely from the restoration of connection, when the actors agree to relinquish some of their power and control for an uncertain common good. The film thus affirms a central thesis: in a fragmented world, only the rebuilding of trust makes the future possible.
## II. Philosophical themes centered on trust and mistrust
(in Raya and the Last Dragon*)*
### 1. Trust and mistrust as political affects
The film presents mistrust not as a simple individual psychological disposition, but as a political affect that structures societies. It is an inherited logic, transmitted through narratives, history, and collective traumas. This distrust is fundamentally defensive: it aims to prevent betrayal, reduce uncertainty, and secure the present. However, as it becomes widespread, it becomes divisive, as it prevents any form of lasting cooperation and traps each group in a rationality of survival.
Conversely, trust is presented as a voluntary act, never automatic. It implies a conscious choice, made with full knowledge of the risk involved. To trust means to accept the possibility of loss, with no guarantee of reciprocity. It is precisely this risk-taking that gives trust its reconstructive power: it opens up a space where social bonds can be reinvented beyond calculation.
This opposition is embodied by the duo Raya/Sisu. Raya represents a traumatized rationality, forged by the experience of betrayal and structured by caution. Sisu, on the other hand, embodies an active, non-dogmatic faith that does not deny danger but refuses to make it the ultimate principle of action. The film does not disqualify Raya's rationality; rather, it shows its limitations when it comes to rebuilding a broken world.
### 2. Collective responsibility and the rejection of scapegoating
One of the film's major philosophical choices is the rejection of any scapegoat. No character can be singled out as solely responsible for the fall of Kumandra. Acts of betrayal always occur within broader contexts: political pressure, inherited fear, conflicting loyalties. Evil thus appears to be systemic, produced by structures of mistrust rather than purely malicious intentions.
This interpretation leads to a decisive shift in the moral question. If the downfall is collective, then the remedy can only be collective as well. No individual, however virtuous, can restore the world alone. The solution is global or non-existent.
The film thus shifts from a morality of blame, focused on finding the person responsible, to an ethic of action, oriented toward the ability to act together in the present. The issue is no longer who caused the disaster, but who is willing to take the risk of a collective action today.
### 3. Tradition, memory, and overcoming trauma
Tradition plays an ambivalent role in the narrative. It is both a reservoir of wisdom and a vehicle for fear. Stories passed down from generation to generation aim to protect, but they also freeze societies in the repetition of trauma. Tradition preserves the memory of the disaster without always offering the means to overcome it.
When memory becomes exclusive, it turns into an obstacle. It prevents any projection into the future by locking individuals into a defensive logic of reproduction: do not repeat past mistakes, even if it means making any new attempts impossible. The film thus shows that memory, if not interpreted, can become paralyzing.
In this context, trust appears as a conscious break with the repetition of the past. It does not imply forgetting or denying the trauma, but a refusal to grant it absolute power over the present. Trusting then becomes a major political and ethical act: choosing the future without erasing the wound, but without submitting to it.
## III. Trust and mistrust at Disney: scenes compared in other films
### 1. Trust betrayed or threatened
In several Disney films, trust initially appears as a fragile bond, exposed to betrayal. It is often placed at the heart of fundamental relationships—family, romantic, or political—whose breakdown leads to profound disorder.
In The Lion King, Scar's betrayal is the archetype of perverted trust. The relationship of family trust is exploited to gain power, and this intimate rupture immediately results in political collapse: the kingdom becomes barren, and the law of the strongest replaces the symbolic order. Private betrayal thus has collective consequences.
In a different way, Frozen contrasts two figures of trust. On the one hand, there is the false love embodied by Hans, based on calculation and self-interest; on the other, there is the sisterly trust between Anna and Elsa, long hindered by fear. The film deconstructs the idea of immediate romantic trust and values a bond that is built, tested, sometimes painful, but authentic.
### 2. Trust as a moral test
Other Disney films approach trust not as a given, but as a moral test, set in a social context marked by fear, prejudice, or tradition.
In Zootopia, mistrust is institutionalized in the form of social stereotypes. Fear of the other structures civic relations and legitimizes exclusion. Rebuilding the bond does not come through the denial of differences, but through a collective awareness of the mechanisms of fear and domination. Here, trust becomes a political endeavor, slow and conflictual.
In Moana, trust takes a more intimate but equally decisive form. The heroine must choose between the protective tradition of her people and the inner calling that pushes her toward the unknown. Trusting the ocean means accepting to disobey a frozen memory in order to reconnect with a deeper truth. Trust becomes an act of emancipation.
### 3. Raya's uniqueness in the Disney corpus
Raya and the Last Dragon stands out clearly from these stories. Trust is neither naive nor idealized, nor reduced to an interpersonal relationship. It is political, collective, and deeply costly.
Unlike many Disney films where trust is rewarded with love, recognition, or the restoration of order, Raya asserts a more radical thesis: trust is never a guarantee of success. It implies possible loss, failure, even disappearance. It engages not only individuals, but the entire social body.
In this sense, Raya marks a philosophical turning point in the Disney corpus. Trust no longer appears as a moral reward granted to the righteous, but as a necessary risk, without which no rebuilding of the world is possible. It becomes the very condition of the future, not simply its outcome.

## Conclusion — Trust, fear, and the rebuilding of politics
(comparative reading: Spinoza, Hobbes, Arendt)
The analysis of Raya and the Last Dragon highlights a powerful philosophical thesis that is rarely formulated so explicitly in animated films: the survival of a political world depends not only on the control of fear, but also on the ability to rebuild trust after trauma. This issue is directly echoed by several major thinkers in modern and contemporary political philosophy.
For Spinoza, fear is a fundamental affect of political life, but it cannot constitute a lasting principle of government. In the Theological-Political Treatise, he shows that societies based on fear tend to produce servitude rather than freedom. Trust, understood as an expression of increased collective power (potentia multitudinis), is not a naive sentiment but an effect of rational cooperation. Raya illustrates this point precisely: fear, embodied by the Druun, reduces the power to act collectively, while trust restores the collective capacity to act, which is the very condition of freedom.
Conversely, Hobbes makes fear the original foundation of political order. In Leviathan, the fear of violent death justifies the transfer of power to a sovereign authority responsible for ensuring security. The fragmented world of Kumandra is reminiscent of the Hobbesian state of nature, marked by widespread mistrust and latent war of all against all. However, Raya radically departs from the Hobbesian solution: no sovereign, no central authority imposes order through coercion. On the contrary, the film suggests that fear, while it may explain the collapse of the world, is incapable of ensuring its reconstruction.
It is with Hannah Arendt that this interpretation finds its most fruitful point of convergence. Arendt distinguishes between power, born of concerted collective action, and violence, which appears when power has already dissolved. In Raya, violence and mistrust signal precisely the absence of true power. The final reconstruction does not come about through domination or force, but through an act of common action, fragile, reversible, but irreducibly political. Trust here is not a private feeling: it is the condition of possibility for collective action and a new beginning.
Thus, Raya and the Last Dragon can be read as an original narrative synthesis of these three perspectives. Contrary to Hobbes, the film asserts that fear does not provide a lasting foundation for politics. With Spinoza, it suggests that trust increases the power of collective action. And in the wake of Arendt, it shows that any rebuilding of the world requires a collective act without guarantees, accepting the fragility of human bonds.
In this sense, Raya does not merely tell a story of reconciliation. It offers a true philosophy of renewal: in a world marked by violence and mistrust, trust is neither given nor deserved, but risky, costly, and politically necessary.
