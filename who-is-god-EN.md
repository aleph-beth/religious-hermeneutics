## Table legend

This table offers a non-denominational comparative analysis of the major religious, philosophical, and spiritual traditions based on six distinct conceptual dimensions.
It does not aim to evaluate the truth of beliefs or to rank traditions, but rather to highlight their thought structures.

## Definition of columns

Ontology (God):
The way in which the divine is conceived: a personal being, an impersonal principle, a symbolic structure, or the absence of God.

Causality:
The existence or non-existence of a necessary order connecting phenomena, which cannot be suspended by divine will.

Divine will:
The capacity attributed to God to act by free or arbitrary decision, independently of any stable order.

Relationship to the world:
Position of the divine in relation to the world: transcendence, immanence, or mixed model.

Law:
Existence of normative mediation (legal, moral, or symbolic) between the divine, the world, and humans.

Interpretation:
Role recognized for exegesis, debate, and controlled plurality of meanings in the understanding of texts and doctrines.

## Symbol convention

✅: fully assumed dimension

◐: partially assumed or mediated dimension

❌: absent or explicitly rejected dimension

## Methodological note

The use of the term God in this table is functional and not substantive.
It serves as a comparative entry point, including for traditions where the concept of God is absent or radically redefined (as in Buddhism or certain philosophies).

The table thus highlights that the decisive divide is not between belief and unbelief, but between mediated thought (law, structure, interpretation) and unmediated voluntarism.
