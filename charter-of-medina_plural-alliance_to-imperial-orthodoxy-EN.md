# The Charter of Medina: from pluralistic alliance to imperial orthodoxy
## **Part I — The Charter of Medina: an explicitly pluralistic *umma***

### **I.1. Medina: a predominantly Jewish city before the pact**

Any historically rigorous reading of the Medina Charter must start from a fact that is often downplayed in subsequent reconstructions: **at the beginning of the 7th century, Yathrib/Medina was not a predominantly Muslim city**. Of the five major tribal groups that structured the city and its immediate territory, **three were established Jewish tribes** (Banū Qaynuqāʿ, Banū Naḍīr, Banū Qurayẓa), with their own economic networks, alliances, laws, and political memory.

The Arab clans—Aws and Khazraj—were themselves divided by various religious affiliations and did not constitute a homogeneous confessional bloc. Muhammad's preaching therefore took place in an **already pluralistic** space, where Judaism was neither marginal nor external, but **structural**.

This point is decisive: the Charter does not integrate minorities into a pre-existing Muslim community; it **organizes a common space in which Jews are central actors**.

### **I.2. Status of the document: a covenant, not a religious text**

The Charter of Medina belongs to the Semitic genre of **covenant** and is not a religious founding document. Its function is primarily political: to end cycles of revenge, organize intertribal solidarity, establish rules of collective responsibility, and ensure common defense.

No article imposes a shared belief, ritual, or confession. The text does not seek to produce orthodoxy, but **social stability**. The law is minimal, pragmatic, and oriented toward coexistence.

This logic is deeply compatible with the Jewish concept of *berît*: the covenant does not eliminate plurality, it regulates it.

### **I.3. Jews and Christians as full members of the *umma***

Contrary to later confessional readings, the Charter explicitly states that **Jews are members of the *umma***. They are not external allies or subordinate protégés, but **constitutive partners** of the political community.

The *umma* is therefore not defined by adherence to a single faith, but by participation in the covenant. It includes:

* the Meccan emigrants (Muhājirūn),
* the Medinan clans (Anṣār),
* the established Jewish tribes,
 
* other monotheistic groups—including Christians—present on an individual or clan basis.

In this context, **Judaism and Christianity are not outside the community**, but integrated into the same political structure. Religious differences are neither denied nor hierarchized; they are simply **outside the scope of the pact**.

### **I.4. *Umma*: an inclusive political community**

The term *umma*, as used in the Charter, refers to a **community of responsibility**, not a church. It refers to a legal and military confederation based on loyalty to the pact and solidarity in the face of external threats.

Being a member of the *umma* means:

* participating in the common defense, 
* respecting the clauses of internal non-violence, 
* accepting a shared arbitration framework.

This definition fully includes Jews and other monotheists. The *umma* is therefore, at this stage, **multiconfessional in principle**.

### **I.5. *Muslim* and *muʾmin*: non-denominational categories**

In the context of the Charter, the terms *Muslim* and *muʾmin* do not yet refer to exclusive religious affiliations.

* *Muslim* describes someone who **acts loyally**, respects the alliance, and does not betray the pact. 
* *Muʾmin*, derived from the root ʾ-m-n (security, trust), refers to someone who **enters into a relationship of trust**.

These categories can apply to Jews or Christians as long as their behavior meets the requirements of the pact. The distinction is **ethical and political**, not theological.

### **I.6. A *umma* before Islam as a religion**

The Charter of Medina thus bears witness to a time before Islam was established as an institutional religion. It describes an **inclusive** *umma*, where Jews, Christians, and other monotheistic groups are full members of a political community governed by the covenant.

This observation helps us understand the subsequent tension: when the *umma* was redefined as an exclusive religious community, **Jews and Christians did not leave the community by breaking away**, but through **retroactive reclassification** of vocabulary.

The historical strength of the Charter lies precisely in this point: it preserves the memory of a time when community preceded religion, when the alliance took precedence over orthodoxy, and when plurality was not a problem to be solved, but a fact to be organized.

## **Part II — From political confederation to theological closure**

### **II.1. The moment of crisis: conflict, rupture, and rewriting of the pact**

The pluralistic dynamic promoted by the Charter of Medina did not remain in a neutral historical space. It was quickly subjected to internal tensions related to war, ruptures in alliances, and the recomposition of power. Conflicts with certain Jewish tribes, armed clashes, and the gradual assertion of Muhammad's authority as supreme arbiter altered the initial framework of the pact.

At this stage, it was not yet a theology in the strict sense, but rather a political hardening. Plurality remained formally accepted, but it was now conditional on the recognition of a central authority. The pact ceased to be strictly horizontal; it became asymmetrical. This transformation marked a first decisive shift: the alliance was no longer merely contractual, it became subordinate.

This shift did not immediately abolish pluralism, but it weakened its internal logic. Coexistence was now based less on reciprocity than on loyalty to a decision-making center.

### **II.2. The closure of the scriptural debate**

A major indication of this turning point is the gradual disappearance of any real scriptural debate with other monotheistic traditions. While the initial framework allowed for the coexistence of distinct legal norms and textual references, the rise of a central authority led to the closure of the hermeneutic field.

Jewish texts were no longer considered parallel normative systems, but traditions outside a now unified order. This closure did not yet stem from an elaborate doctrine, but from a political necessity: the existence of normative pluralities became incompatible with the assertion of stable central power.

Thus, it is not theological divergence that causes exclusion, but the structural incompatibility between legal pluralism and political centralization.

### **II.3. The reinterpretation of vocabulary: from an open lexicon to exclusive categories**

It is in this context that a decisive transformation of vocabulary takes place. Terms that were initially open and behavioral gradually acquired an exclusive identity value.

* *Muslim* ceased to refer to someone who respected the pact and became a member of a distinct group.
 
* *Muʾmin* moved away from the logic of trust and contractual fidelity to refer to a standardized inner belief.
 
* *Umma* tightened around a homogeneous core, now defined by adherence to the same doctrinal framework.

This evolution did not correspond to a sudden break, but rather to a cumulative reinterpretation. The words did not change; their semantic field contracted. Language, initially functional, became ontological.

### **II.4. From pact to norm: the birth of a religious order**

The transition from confederation to established religion occurs when the pact ceases to be an instrument of coexistence and becomes a criterion of belonging. Political loyalty is gradually redefined as religious fidelity.

This process is foreign to the Jewish logic of the covenant, where the plurality of nations remains structural. It corresponds more to an emerging imperial logic, in which political unity requires normative homogeneity.

The Law, initially minimal and pragmatic, becomes denser. It becomes prescriptive in the strong sense, bearing an exclusive truth. This moment marks the emergence of an Islam in the process of religious institutionalization, distinct from neighboring monotheistic traditions.

### **II.5. The erasure of pluralism as a condition of unity**

The gradual exclusion of divergence is not presented as a rupture, but as a clarification. The memory of the initial pluralism is preserved, but reinterpreted through a theological lens that neutralizes it.

Jews, once full members of the political community, are now located outside the *umma*. Their status is no longer that of partners, but of distinct groups subject to a majority order.

This shift is not simply a matter of religious hostility. It responds to a logic of identity construction: for a unified religious system to be established, plurality must be reclassified as otherness.

### **II.6. A retrospective reinterpretation: the Charter as a founding myth**

The transmission of the text of the Charter by the historiographers of the 8th and 9th centuries was part of an already theologized framework. The document was then reinterpreted as the founding act of a unified religious community, rather than as a circumstantial multicultural pact.

This retrospective reinterpretation created an internal tension: a pluralistic text was integrated into an exclusive doctrinal narrative. The Charter ceased to be a testimony to coexistence and became a founding myth, legitimizing an already established religious order.

This transformation sheds light on the ambiguous status of the document: fundamental not for Islamic theology, but for understanding the transition from a pluralistic political order to a unified religious system.

### **Interim conclusion**

Part II highlights a process of gradual closure: what was initially an open vocabulary, inscribed in a logic of pact, becomes a language of exclusive identity. This shift is not the result of a sudden revelation or a doctrinal break, but of a political and hermeneutic reconfiguration.

The Charter of Medina thus appears as the site of a major historical shift: one in which a multicultural alliance is transformed, in successive layers, into the symbolic foundation of an institutional religion. This dynamic paved the way for the Umayyad turning point, when imperial centralization and the theologization of vocabulary reached their full maturity.

## **Part III — The Umayyad turning point: from inherited plurality to imperial unification**

### **III.1. Change of scale: from city-pact to empire**

The Umayyad turning point marks a decisive change of scale. Whereas the Medina Charter operated within the limited space of a pluralistic city regulated by a pact, Umayyad power was based on an imperial, territorial, and administrative logic. This structural transformation imposed new constraints: governing an empire required a unifying, stable, and transmissible norm.

In this context, the original pluralism inherited from the Medina period became difficult to sustain. The coexistence of multiple legal and identity systems, tolerable at the level of a local confederation, became a factor of fragility for a centralized power. Unification was no longer merely political; it became normative.

### **III.2. Theologization as a response to the imperial imperative**

The theologization of vocabulary is not a purely religious phenomenon. It is a functional response to the imperial imperative. In order to administer, collect taxes, administer justice, and mobilize populations, the government must have clear, exclusive, and hierarchical categories at its disposal.

The terms *Muslim*, *muʾmin*, and *umma*, which were still open and relational in their ancient usage, gradually became stabilized as categories of belonging. This fixation made it possible to clearly distinguish between:

* those who were fully subject to the imperial order, 
* those who were integrated into it in a subordinate manner, 
* and those who were outside it.

Theology thus became a tool for political clarification. It provided the authorities with a language capable of producing unity where the pact had produced coexistence.

### **III.3. Exclusion as a mechanism of stabilization**

In this new framework, exclusion is not presented as arbitrary violence, but as a mechanism of stabilization. Defining a homogeneous religious *umma* makes it possible to transform inherited diversity into structured otherness.

Jews and Christians, who could initially be included in a political community based on the covenant, are now located outside the community of believers. Their status becomes legally and symbolically distinct. This externalization is not only doctrinal; it is administrative and fiscal.

The transition is decisive: difference is no longer managed through internal plurality, but through separation.

### **III.4. The establishment of the narrative of origins**

It was also during the Umayyad period that the narrative of origins was consolidated. Earlier texts were collected, ordered, and reread in light of the imperial order in place. In this context, the Charter of Medina ceased to be perceived as a circumstantial historical compromise.

It became a founding text, supposed to contain from the outset the religious categories that had now been stabilized. This reinterpretation produced an illusion of continuity: what was the result of political and theological evolution appeared to be a primitive given.

The historicity of vocabulary was thus neutralized. Words seemed to have always carried the meaning they acquired later.

### **III.5. Break with the Semitic logic of the covenant**

From the perspective of Jewish thinking on the covenant, this turning point constitutes a profound break. The biblical berît accepts the plurality of nations as a structural given of human history. Unity is always relational and never absorbing.

Conversely, Umayyad unification is based on a logic of homogenization. The Law is no longer a minimal framework for coexistence, but the expression of a single truth linking identity, norms, and belief. The transition from covenant to orthodoxy marks an anthropological change: belonging now takes precedence over practice.

### **III.6. A religion built on politics**

Part III thus allows us to clearly formulate the central hypothesis: Islam as an institutional religion does not precede the empire; it develops alongside it. Religious language stabilizes at a time when power needs fixed categories.

The Charter of Medina is therefore not the starting point of a finished religion, but one of the materials reinterpreted by an imperial order in search of legitimacy. This reversal of perspective allows us to understand the permanent tension between the pluralism of origins and the exclusivism of classical forms.

### **Interim conclusion**

The Umayyad turning point appears to be the moment when vocabulary was captured by the state. What was once part of the grammar of alliance became the language of identity. Plurality, which was a constituent part of the initial pact, was reclassified as otherness.

This change was neither a simple religious hardening nor a moral betrayal. It responded to a historical necessity: governing an empire requires clear symbolic boundaries. Understanding this process allows us to restore the Charter of Medina to its true status: not that of a founding dogma, but that of a precious witness to a time before institutional religion.

## **General conclusion — From alliance to orthodoxy**

This study has proposed a reinterpretation of the Charter of Medina that breaks with its apologetic or doctrinal use. Far from being the founding text of an established religion, the Charter appears to be a **pluralistic political pact**, inscribed in a Semitic logic of alliance, where coexistence takes precedence over unification, and where the categories of *muslim*, *muʾmin*, and *umma* belong to a **behavioral and relational register**, not a confessional one.

Analysis of the successive layers of the text has revealed a **gradual shift**, rather than a sudden one: from a multicultural confederation based on loyalty and shared responsibility to an increasingly normative, then identity-based language. This shift did not result from a new revelation, but from a **political reconfiguration** made necessary by the centralization of power.

The Umayyad turning point was the decisive moment in this transformation. Confronted with the imperial scale, the authorities appropriated the vocabulary inherited from the pact and fixed it in exclusive categories. Theology then became an **instrument of stabilization**, producing unity where the alliance had produced plurality. The Charter is reinterpreted retrospectively as a founding myth, erasing the historicity of its terms and naturalizing a belated exclusivism.

This reinterpretation allows us to understand a structural tension that is still active today: between an **original pluralism**, enshrined in the practice of the alliance, and a **unified religious order**, constructed in and by the empire. It also sheds light on the specificity of the break with Jewish berît thought, for which the plurality of peoples remains constitutive of human history.

By restoring the Medina Charter's status as a **transitional text**, this study does not seek to close the debate, but rather to shift its terms. The question is not whether Islam is essentially pluralistic or exclusive, but rather to recognize that its religious language has been historically constructed, in layers, from a political pact that predates institutional religion.

Understanding this process means reopening the space for a critical, historical, and non-confessional reading of the texts, which alone is capable of bringing together alliance, power, and religion in the Semitic world.
